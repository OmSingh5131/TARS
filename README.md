# TARS Chatbot (Gemma 3 1B Fine-tune)

This repository contains the Python script to run and chat with **TARS**, a custom fine-tuned version of `google/gemma-3-1b-it`.

The bot is trained to emulate the TARS persona from *Interstellar* (90% honesty setting, of course) and requires a special "emotion" tag to function correctly.
